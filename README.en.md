# Life Money Skill — Career Monetization Diagnostic

[简体中文](README.md) ｜ **English**

Turn career monetization into one runnable flow: **profile intake → 7-round analysis → a single-file HTML report you can actually read**.

> Send your résumé and career story in, get a single-file HTML career-monetization diagnostic out — hidden skills, income opportunities, leverage, higher-pay directions, AI side services and a 90-day plan.

> Status: v1.0.0 ｜ Hermes Agent Skill

## What it solves

| Pain point | What Life Money does |
|---|---|
| You don't know which of your skills can be sold | Round 1 is a hidden-skills audit — it digs market-payable abilities out of your real experience, with evidence |
| You want a side income but don't know where to start | Every income opportunity ships with a "first step" you can execute this week |
| Plans die after kickoff — no acceptance criteria | The 90-day plan has 3 phases, each with a verifiable milestone |
| Goals are vague ("I want 10k/month") | Gate 2 forces a confirmed monthly extra-income target; every income figure is aligned to it |
| Side-hustle ideas don't fit your real hours | Gate 3 confirms your weekly launch hours; every AI service is capped by that budget |

## How to use

Inside the Agent with this Skill installed, just say:

```
Run a career monetization diagnostic on me — here's my résumé
```

```
I only have 6 hours a week and want an extra 2,000/month — what can I do?
```

The Agent then runs: intake (materials + interview) → 7-round analysis (2 mid-way confirmations) → render report → deliver.

## Workflow

```
Your materials + interview
    │
    ├─ L1 Intake ────Gate 1──▶ profile.json
    ├─ L2 Analysis ──Gate 2/3▶ analysis.json (7 rounds)
    ├─ L3 Render ────────────▶ report.html
    └─ L4 Verify & deliver ──▶ projects/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/
```

**Not doing**: no external LLM API (the Agent runs the analysis); no user data in the repository; no income guarantees.

## The three gates (cannot be skipped)

| Gate | Trigger point | What the user does | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | L1 intake | Provide materials (résumé / project reports / portfolio) and confirm | — |
| 2 | After hidden skills, before income opportunities | Choose the monthly extra-income target | 1,000-3,000 CNY / month |
| 3 | Before AI services | Enter weekly launch hours | 6 hours |

## Installation

This repository is the **development repo (single source of truth)**; the copy installed inside Hermes is a thin router. Installation is not done yet.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuoJiangYong/life-money-skill.git
```

## Self-check

```bash
python scripts/verify_repo.py
```

1. **Contract validation** — examples ↔ both JSON Schemas (zero-dependency validator with a keyword whitelist; fails loudly instead of passing silently)
2. **Render smoke test** — runs `render_report.py` and produces a report
3. **Structure check** — component counts must match exactly (10 / 10 / 5 / 3 / 5 / 7 / 3 / 5 / 10)

CI runs the same checks on every push, plus a repository boundary check (`projects/` must never be committed).

## Credits

The methodology is adapted from **@Raul_IA_Prod** on X — 7 prompts (originally in Spanish, translated and localized) that turn "I don't know what I can do" into an actionable monetization path. The 7 analysis dimensions are rebuilt to this Skill's spec; the report appendix keeps the original prompts verbatim so they stay reusable.
